This entry is motivated by the concern I have regarding the increasing enfranchisement of new right-wing movements. I am essentially interested in mobilizing power of their online communities and the question of how to resist such a pervasive structure. I cannot hope to comprehensively answer the question of resistance, but I want to draw a picture of the current state of affairs, from the perspective of someone who cannot imagine a life without an intricately networked online experience. My interest lies in the intersection of melodrama and Big Data (referring to the amassing of large volumes of data, by [collection corporations](http://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/big-data/what-is-big-data.html#dmusers), that are then used to structure the way we receive content as users of platforms), and is twofold: I want to draw a picture of these two modes of governmentality and to try to read current politics in terms of this model. My intention here is not to make predictions, but to look at how the edgy and seemingly removed depths of 4chan can have consequences in our real world. As a case study, I will consider the grassroots news agencies, specifically The Rebel News, operating in Toronto, Canada. In the interest of comprehensive coverage, I will also consider other notable online figures. 

## Our story begins with governmentality…

There is still the contention that we operate in a society still governed by the body that is elected by the people. That is, some citizens still have complete faith in the democratic system. This conception that is characteristic of liberalism is founded on a rational subject that can take part in political discourse. The idea is built on a cornerstone of free speech and human rights, which like anything, can be abused depending on [the rhetoric used](https://github.com/kredati/control-encyclopedia/wiki/Governmentality#melodrama). To go back further in history, we can glean the philosophies of liberalism at the point where government transitioned from the sovereign. Here, broadly speaking from the sixteenth century to the eighteenth century (Foucault, "Governmentality", 208), the governing power was transitioning from a prince who stood apart from society and who governed his principality, to a democratic authority introducing economic logic into the political sphere. That is, the tactics of government were deployed not to strengthen a principality but to make governing things efficient, and to make government itself self-sustaining within the population (Foucault, "Governmentality", 206-207).  The virtue of government, then, becomes the “right disposition of things” Foucault, "Governmentality", 208).  Integral to this governance is the construction of a population, and the government continues to justify itself by making its mandate the maximum welfare of that population (Foucault, "Governmentality", 215). 

The family, the unit of people that was governed by the sovereign, found its importance diminished as the collection of statistics began and the liberal government found it more effective to govern based on demographics (Foucault, "Governmentality", 216). Within the abstracted liberal population, the family though still privileged, became subordinate. Now, it was reasoned, the tactics of government could operate according to demographic statistics (Foucault, "Governmentality", 215). Michel Foucault’s theory of governmentality – defined as the history of tactics that the government employs to manage its population – mainly concerns the relation of the individual to the state. His story begins to explain the introduction of economics into the government; since the goal of the government was efficiency in providing for the maximum happiness of its population, to rule the state was to rule the economy. It is also worth mentioning that the original use of the word economy referred to the governing of the family, and has since been changed to refer to processes of the population in general (Foucault, "Governmentality", 216-217). In the era of an internet-society, I would even go so far as to say that the relationship between the population and the tactics of government have drastically changed as well. This will be addressed in further depth later on.  In any case, the current government has taken the introduction of economy to it’s logical extreme. Now, the mentality of the government is to foster the most competition, and so it ends up involve corporate interests in the political sphere at an increasing rate. For a more in-depth analysis of neoliberalism, refer to the entry on [[financialization|financialization]].

## Melodrama

Melodrama is the story of a virtuous individual, who is beset on all sides by the corrupt and villainous (Anker, 2). In the political sphere, this translates to policies and practices that are implemented based on this rhetoric (Anker, 2). In Elizabeth Anker’s example, she uses the popular narrative that told the story of 9/11: an evil, maniacal terrorist agency came to threaten the American values of liberty and freedom. The emotion it produced in the general populace allowed for the introduction of invasive security measures in the name of freedom (Anker, 12). To be clear, she does not restrict the use of melodrama to one side of the political spectrum; the rhetorical mode is used everywhere. The notable example on the left is the Abolitionist movement, which used the tortured slave as an emotional impetus for societal change (Anker, 2).

My case study looks at the right-wing’s use of the melodrama of free speech. Melodrama, as a mode, traditionally locates the threat externally – it is only when this threat is eliminated that the virtuous individual will be safe. In this entry, I focus on Rebel Media’s YouTube channel, because they seem to echo the sentiments in the most coherent way, and because their journalistic presence has more impact than the forums where the idea comes from. It is reasonable to assume that the White House is more likely to let a [reporter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmSSgtBe-CE) in than an anonymous 4chan commenter.

Regarding their content, I have noticed that within the last few months before writing, their anxieties have been limited to [Motion-103](http://www.parl.gc.ca/HouseChamberBusiness/ChamberVoteDetail.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=42&Ses=1&Vote=237&GroupBy=party&FltrParl=42&FltrSes=1), a motion which has now been passed in Parliament requesting investigation into the recent attacks on Muslims, and free speech, which all culminate in anger towards PM Justin Trudeau.  These are, of course, not mutually exclusive. In general, they seem concerned about their loss of power in the [democratic process](https://youtu.be/9sjknEqGxsc?t=90) and the upset of the status quo which privileges a certain [white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_DdbgBr1Fc), [male](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhQ2EgS-Enw), [rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTwrplPZHxE), [cis](https://youtu.be/2vvaEoVg3go?list=PL2HWRRSziC_GFvUW6YTmCzddDVkKuue1N) and able-bodied subject. In fact, a major unifying cause was to fight the inclusion of [gender-neutral pronouns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_cAtfyhec) because it infringes on free speech. They gain legitimacy by using minorities as newscasters – these people become the symbol for the rational post-oppression subject, and come out in support of policies like [anti-immigration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7953f-jsgb4) laws created in the fear of violence to the [defenceless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBg4gRkq8lM). In addition to allowing other [right-wing minorities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FwApDWFOoA) more legitimacy, it gives other (in this case) white supporters the permission to repeat the same things. The organization stands as the [last bastions of freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg7quoymDPg), as the only ones with reason on their side. In some cases, they take the offence and [attack the melodrama of the opposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr7MRmN7rQQ). A quick glance at the comments on these videos will give you the sense that these viewers are perhaps [worse than the newscasters themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP_3L8CcFQ8).The video I linked here is also interesting – it represents their (failed) attempt to reform their public image. Not only has this alienated a large portion of their viewership (downvotes on the video had about a 4:1 ratio) but at the time of this writing, the newscasters themselves have proven to at least [ally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3OCKAnBed0) themselves with [white nationalists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzaO3h_mKtc).

## Hold Up…

It is evident by now that my own political leanings are on the left, and the reader could make a good argument that I am falling prey to the trap of melodrama myself. From my perspective, the immigrants and poor are the virtuous, and the forces of white nationalism are closing in on them. I must take this chance to mention that Elizabeth Anker, the source of this argument, does not pass judgement on specific melodrama herself. Her work reads as left-leaning because of the effects she reads into the post-9/11 rhetoric, as ushering in the attitude that cannot but give the state more control, in the confusion of emotion. She calls this "felt legitimacy" (Anker, 27). Of course, in my argument, the effects I am linking to this melodrama are the [increasing strength of neo-Nazi factions](http://anti-racistcanada.blogspot.ca/2016/08/soldiers-of-odin-canadian-media-paying.html) in Toronto  and harmful ideologies in general, but there is an interesting shortcoming of this theory to consider. In taking this approach, Anker follows the methodology of Foucault, who argues that to study power is to study its effects – the essential being of power is not necessarily unified and cannot be directly observed (Foucault, "The Subject and Power", 327). Thus, to criticize this work, we must go back to the source;  Foucault’s work creates a transcendent being of Power, who stands apart from socio-political relations and whose inner workings are mysterious and unknowable (Frederici, 15). Anker’s work is only a call to resistance so far as the reader condemns the effects of the melodrama she mentions. However, her model makes it hard to enact any resistance – if power is a multiplicity, combating its effects seem like cutting the heads off the Hydra. I argue she does not do justice to what is motivating the melodrama itself. To be sure, studying the way power shows up is useful, and both these methodologies start in the same way, but draw different conclusions. The point I am trying to get across, then, is that though the left and right are using similar rhetorical modes, the content plays an equally important role in motivating the type of action used to resist it. 

However, this entry looks at governmentality and must continue with a Foucauldian method of analysis. My essential claim is that there is an intersection of curated online spaces, the pervasive [[algorithms|algorithm]] which form your digital identity, melodrama, and the way that citizens are increasingly separated from the government, because of the tight relationship between corporate and governmental interest.

## Online Connectivity

Until now, this entry has largely focused on YouTube spaces as being representative of the ‘alt-right’ youth movements in general. I have done this so that the reader could get a good sense of the rhetoric. Of course, these spaces are usually dismissed as being comprised of angry pre-teens who have not had enough exposure to the world to be considered a threat. This argument does not hold weight for a few reasons. First, it neglects to consider that these forum contributors grow up. As a university student, I can vote and participate in [government](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/10/23/19-year-old-student-wins-niagara-pc-nomination.html). I can also be tried as an adult in a court of law; society itself considers my demographic to now hold [significant power](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-youth-turnout-2015-1.3636290). If we assume that (at least in this writer’s case) students start really taking part in the internet around 2010, they would have been just in time for the launch of Richard Spencer’s [alt-right blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131206235415/http://alternativeright.com/about-us). The burst of far-right movements now, seven years after the fact, could in part be explained by the increasing involvement youth have in politics. The existence of these forums also provides an outlet for news sources to gauge interest and create content. This becomes a self-sustaining cycle: people listen to these bloggers and journalists, who are in turn encouraged by the apparent demand. It is also a lucrative venture. As an example of this, Jordan Peterson, the professor who refuses to use trans-friendly pronouns, has made [$27,000](https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson) since October, at the time of this writing.  As well, it is hard to ignore the examples of #gamergate and the number of violent incidents occurring at least in some part as a consequence of the /b/ 4chan community and ‘beta’ culture. For a comprehensive history of this phenomenon, click [here](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/new-man-4chan-nagle). Especially in the #gamergate controversy, there was concrete evidence that corporations’ marketing tactics were [influenced by backlash](http://digiday.com/marketing/gamergate-experiences-mixed-success/) from their customers. (To say nothing of the rampant misogyny within gamer culture.) Comparatively speaking, it seems that the average individual has more influence on the corporation than they could in government. 

The communities I am describing here provide an interesting way to ask questions about governmentality itself. The nature of the population itself has changed – they can be quantified more efficiently, and have governmental tactics deployed against them, but they also could respond back in a public and instantaneous way. This is also true regardless of age, education or experience. It is important to notice that the response is not as different as it was previously – the top-down governing of the population still exists – but that there is the capacity for direct contact changes things. I bring melodrama into my argument so that I can create a picture of how people are mobilized. As was historically true, people today rally around melodrama, but they have the potential to not only mobilize across borders and continents, but to use platforms like YouTube to create a ubiquitous presence that seems hard to surmount.

## The Intersection

Having drawn this picture of the online space as defined by its consumers, it is also important to include corporate and governmental interests. When reading government today as ‘neoliberal’ it is argued that its reasoning – the goal of encouraging maximum competition – converts the democratic characteristics of government into economic ones (Brown, 17). As such, the realms of social network corporations and the political process are blurred as well. In the wake of the most recent election, those looking for a possible explanation as to the rise of Trump have shown interesting findings when looking at big data  companies. Analysts found that the political campaign was tailored to the current internet moment, on specific platforms, and propagated the appropriate message depending on the findings of big data companies (that Steve Bannon is heavily involved in. This says more about the ascendancy of Trump, as at the time of this writing, there is a shifting of offices. Nevertheless, the presence of data collection companies in the campaign is [hard to refute](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage).) Of course, this is not to say that Hillary Clinton ran a perfect campaign, but it is hard to see the rise of the alt-right and Trump’s election as coincidence. The other significant aspect of an effective internet campaign is the global reach. Facebook, for example, is an American company, and so heavily biased towards American culture. Even though there were rumors that Facebook realized Trump was harnessing big data for his campaign and tried to stop trending topics from being noticed by [users](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/big-data-and-psychographic-profiling-helped-donald-trump-win-the-us-presidential-election-359960.html), Facebook could not stop content that came from its average user. Platform points would disseminate by word-of-mouth, in a multi-media environment, with tech-savvy participants who could download, edit and distribute their own video clips. If anything, on a personal note, I noticed that the traditional sources of news mattered little. It was realistic that youth voters could form their opinions without ever watching a debate (although those were streamed online as well).

Sousveillance, or the recording of authorities by those not in power (Browne, 19), is always relevant. Thus far, I have linked videos that are polished, but there is much to be said about these Toronto journalists who come to protests and film events, on both sides. (As an example of this, compare [The Rebel's footage](https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/827955029139144706) with [a leftist's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxiAZF0G7SU&feature=youtu.be).) The sheer number of videos disseminated and protests that have taken place since the election of Trump also speaks to a new tendency in online rhetoric – that the perpetual engagement with this violence and action has desensitized the general public and has served to test the limits of other institutional power, namely the courts and the police. For example, if someone had said that neo-Nazis chapters in Toronto had planned a [protest](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/violence-breaks-out-as-protesters-clash-in-nathan-phillips-square-1.4051336) the same day as the [international outdoor pillow fight](http://www.torontosun.com/2017/04/01/outdoor-pillow-fight-a-big-hit) a couple of years ago, they might not have been believed.

The other area of influence I wanted to look at was the curated nature of online spaces. Faced with a monolith of content, users have the choice to personalize their newsfeeds, or go to certain forums and blogs. Of course, this varies between platforms – a Facebook user’s curation is to a large extent predetermined by content put forth by Facebook, whereas Reddit’s algorithm is less restrictive (that is, users subscribe to preferred streams and consume content only from them).  There is also medium specificity regarding the use of the platforms; Facebook and Reddit’s user interface is conducive to discussion-style engagement, while platforms like Twitter are for breaking news-type reporting (Evans, 326). The reinforcement and continuous interaction with others on these forum-style communities are exacerbated by both selective exposure theory – the theory that one chooses content that aligns with their political beliefs – and advertising algorithms. These form a pseudo-identity based on histories of content consumption and then narrow content on one’s feed, based on those histories. What is really threatening about this picture are the alt-right’s plans to capitalize on this. As the youth and tech-savvy begin to take over politics, proliferation of this content can only continue and as of January 2017, Richard Spencer showed evidence of trying to centralize  his internet movement. At the risk of making a predictive claim, the alt-right will have a more powerful presence in online communities, and may even extend past the general public into legitimate laws and policies passed by our governments. 

## Resistance

The problem for leftists, then, is to resist these effects of melodrama and digital, neoliberal governmentality. That is, there must be a way to combat the ubiquitous presence of the alt-right on the internet, which both contributes to and is influenced by the close relationship between governments and corporations. The opposition to this media power would also contend with the now-empowered neo-Nazi and right-wing factions. Resistance to this movement has so far comprised of compiling “threat assessment documents” that advise other leftist protestors of the danger during their actions. It has also involved a distributed network of people at rallies witnessing and recording violence instigated by both the police and the [neo-Nazis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1TzPW411BI&sns=fb). In the future, in order to resist the intricate networks between the government, these alt-right figures and the corporations (who have a lot of power to [censor and allow certain content](http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14022472/facebook-hate-speech-moderation-germany-migrant-refugee)), leftists will have to centralize in some regard. At the very least, there must be a news source like The Rebel, that can react to their content and disseminate our own. The major setback here is the lack of funding and the inability to coordinate. I mention these tactics because any resistance now must work with the same system. The goal here is for resistance to be as omnipresent as the opposition and to engage with authorities in an effective way. This new blend of corporate and political government demands that resistance be just as loud, especially moving forward with the new presidency.
