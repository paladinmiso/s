#### Welcome to the Encyclopedia of Control.

### About the Encyclopedia
The Encyclopedia is dedicated to explicating, tracking, and using the thought of French historian and philosopher Michel Foucault, to help explain the contemporary politics of technology. It was written collectively and collaboratively by students in Professor Scott Richmond's "Media, Technology, Control," course in Spring 2017 in the Cinema Studies Institute at the University of Toronto.
