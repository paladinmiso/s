## Introduction: The Difficulty with Definitions 

Although definitions are supposed to be a way of categorizing words for clear comprehension, definitions can be tricky none the less. If one looks up the word “norm” in the Oxford English Dictionary, it reads “something that is usual, typical, or standard” or “a required standard; a level to be complied with or reached”. At first glance, this definition may seem logical and expected for the word at issue, but it still raises two questions. First, how is it that this typicality or standard gets decided upon within and across a population? And second, how does it become a requirement and in turn, and more importantly, what does this mean for the individuals that are required to follow the standard? The goal of this entry is not to fully answer these questions but rather to engage with multiple lines of thought to help negotiate some of the ambiguity. 

To deal with the first problem and how “the usual” comes to be, it is necessary to understand how norms function as contextually specific and also relative. Norms function differently in various contexts, which complicates how they are supposedly agreed upon within a population, and will therefore be explored in this entry. To deal with the second problem, it is possible to ask how power and control work in these contexts to create the meaning of a norm. To engage with these issues, this entry will look at multiple works in three lines of inquiry to see how norms are dealt with in contextually specific ways relevant to the authors and their time of writing. First, while exploring the concepts of the “normal” and “pathological”, Georges Canguilhem engages with issues of normativity in the scientific and medical realm, which is a good starting point as a way to understand how averages define normalcy as a means to put value judgements on health and illness. Next, Michel Foucault engages with norms and their functions of power both in disciplinary systems and sexuality. Lastly, in the contemporary context, it is possible to look at Michael Warner’s work on homosexuality to help provide a new way of conceptualizing norms, by reframing the logic around issues of worth and how they inform behaviour. 

For the scope of this entry, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, norms can take on contextually specific meanings, and they can become abstractions that are assumed to be agreed upon, falsely, across a population. In reality, they are ambiguous and not explicitly determined. Next, norms prove to be significant to a population by becoming an influential power that can mould individual behaviour, through conformity, as a way of exerting control over a population.
