## Confession / Forgive Me Father For I Have Sinned 

Sexually I was a late bloomer… I mean, sexually, I bloomed just on time.. I went through puberty at a regular age, I wasn’t overly shy with girls (I could really talk the talk – all I did was talk the talk), I wasn’t forbidden to go outside where young teenagers met and did young teenager things. I was even popular, knew older kids, and played sports. No, I bloomed just on time, but, my consummation service was.. late. Without getting too much into specifics I attribute this to a visit to Zellers, a purchased box of condoms, a free condom pouch, handcuffs, and a lying undercover mall cop. I also thought about being a priest. I was also extremely romantic. These things resulted in a bizarre mix of desire and guilt, pride and patience, and so while I waited for the perfect someone, being a young lad who loved to learn, I prepared. I trained for the ultimate sport and xvideos.com was my teacher. And wow was there a lot to learn. So many positions, so many angles, so many rhythms, so many styles.  So many hours spent preparing for the big moment. Fast forward past the big moment (It was legendary! I was prepared! simultaneous orgasm –I don’t think she was lying!) to a brief and wondrous relationship  (if you can call it that) with an Egyptian girl in Paris(I know right?), who implored me to do things my teacher had exposed me to, but I dare never do. I was shocked at what she asked me to do, shocked at what I ended up doing, and how much I liked it, how much I fantasized about it afterwards, how much my teacher could never fully explain the pleasures of this thing. I cannot pretend my teacher has always been ethical, he has rightfully been accused of being a heteronormative misogynist and lately I’ve been thinking about how the teachings, i’ve applied to my sex life, may echo my teacher. In a conversation on porn with the Egyptian girl, I voiced these sentiments. “I would’ve been such a good boy without porn :(”. This was met with silence… I had angered her. This notion of remaining untainted by pornography, by the exploration of a variety of forms of pleasure was idiotic and quite privileged. These notions of good boys and good girls, functioning sexually under the oppressive code of some ancient religious discourses on morality were exactly why’d she’d left her country. They were exactly why she was never going back. She’d liked what we’d done, She’d asked for it and me indirectly projecting my guilty feelings on her, was more of the same. We haven’t spoken since.

I realized that it was time to reconsider my established notions of sanctioned sexuality, and really investigate the dominant notion that pornography is an automatic descent into some form of moral decay. Is there such thing as utopic pornography?


## Introduction

When I approached my wiser, infinitely more resourceful Big Brother Google and asked him about ‘sex’, he immediately supplied me with pages worth of information. The most important source for me according to him was an article from _Men’s Health “How To Have Sex Last Longer In Bed”_. My first inclination was to take offence, but then again, who doesn’t need more information on how to last longer. The second source was also from _Men’s Health “12 New Positions You Should Try”_. After a map with a couple local sex shops there was “sex” from __Women’s Health, “Best Sex Positions and Kama Sutra Tips”_ – Cosmo Guide to Hottest Sex_, “Sex” according to Wikipedia and “Sex” Psychology Today. At first I was puzzled by the fact there was no pornography in sight; a click on the Images tab cleared all of that confusion. And then I was puzzled as to how sex according to Wikipedia was so low on the list. I can’t say I was surprised _Cosmo Magazine_ was ranked more pertinent than _Psychology Today_. Once again Big Brother Google seemed to have it all figured out but I was curious as to the rationale behind his choices. 

Sex is everywhere. The saying has been said so many times it’s beyond banal—and yet it’s not true. Sexual imagery is everywhere. It seeps through every possible crevice; where there are images, there will be sexual ones, and like iguanas, we reflect our environments. We as a people are obsessed with sex and the proof is in pornography, which has become a veritable pastime. A study by _Time Magazine_ reported that pornography’s revenues exceeded those of football, baseball and basketball combined (this isn’t even considering all the people who don’t pay for pornography)(BOLD). This phenomenon, which did not always exist, was of interest to me, especially in the larger context of sexuality, society and how pornography functions within it. Starting from the work of Michel Foucault in _The History of Sexuality Vol 1_., which asserts that western society has foregone ars erotica for scientia sexualis, I will examine whether this division is still in place. Foucault himself questions this within his book, “And we must ask whether, since the nineteenth century, the scientia sexualis – under the guise of its decent positivism – has not functioned, at least to a certain extent, as an ars erotica” (71). Scientia sexualis, which positions sex as a problem of truth and has developed “complex machinery for producing true discourses on sex” (Foucault 67), as well as the notion of sexuality, is the focus of Foucault’s discussion. However, Foucault does not give much explanation regarding ars erotica, which situates pleasure as the site of truth. The paper will hone in on contemporary forms of confession, originally formed through the process of a subject defining themselves within the parameters of The Church and in turn the schemes of scientia sexualis. The paper will attempt to trace a general transformation in the functions of confession.  It will first have to establish balanced notions of scientia sexualis and ars erotica, as in his neat and poetic definition of ars erotica, there is much left undefined. Looking at perhaps the most famous example of ars erotica, The Kama Sutra, will help us refine the term. I will then attempt to contextualize these terms in our contemporary moment to determine if and how they have continued to be positioned in relation to each other. My hypothesis is that indeed, scientia sexualis has served as a sort of ars erotica for western societies, and through “ a system of representations” (Foucault 69), erotic artworks slowly seeped and finally exploded into the public conscience, transforming the problem of truth that is sexuality. Our contemporary moment is saturated with erotic art or ars erotica, mainly in the form of pornography. Looking at the widespread “pornification” of western culture and the processes of consumption and eventual rejection of pornography, we will hopefully unearth some important ideas about sexuality in the contemporary moment. 

## Foucault's Scientia Sexualis, Ars Erotica & Confession

In The History of Sexuality Vol. 1, Michel Foucault sets the scene for his discussion on scientia sexualis in the late 19th century, “Throughout the nineteenth century, sex seems to have been incorporated into two very distinct orders of knowledge: a biology of reproduction, which developed continuously according to a general scientific normativity, and a medicine of sex conforming to quite a different rules of formation” (54). Already this is a decisive move, editing the discourse on sex and sexuality to such a small timeframe in order to define it.  However, Foucault expands on the way the truth of sex was manipulated through these orders of knowledge, 

>"This much is undeniable: the learned discourse on sex that was pronounced in the nineteenth century was imbued with age old delusions, but also with systematic blindnesses: a refusal to see and to understand; but further –and this is the crucial point– a refusal concerning the very thing that was brought to light and whose formulation was urgently solicited" (Foucault 55)

Here, Foucault locates the dilemma of what he will later define as scientia sexualis, that definitions of sex were steeped in fears (that he later connects to the church) and a refusal to fully acknowledge the truth, for reasons that can be speculated as a means of control over the powerful force that is sex. Foucault asserted that “The essential point is that sex was not only a matter of sensation and pleasure, of law and taboo, but also of truth and falsehood, that the truth of sex became something fundamental, useful or dangerous, precious or formidable: in short, that sex was constituted as a problem of truth” (Foucault 56). This problem of truth built in to sex enabled its organization. It also necessitated a process of mediation “geared to a form of knowledge-power” (Foucault 58). Here Foucault invokes confession, speaking of the imperative that was placed on pronouncing truths. Less a free expression than a systematic compulsion, he defined the confession as “a ritual of discourse in which the speaking subject is also the subject of the statement; it is also a ritual that unfolds within a power relationship, for one does not confess without the presence (or virtual presence) of a partner who is not simply the interlocutor but the authority who requires the confession, prescribes and appreciates it, and intervenes in order to judge, punish, forgive, console and reconcile.” (Foucault 62). For Michel Foucault this definition of confession extends into a variety of areas, not simply the Church and issues of sex. Rather in the connection of science to sex, sexuality becomes implicit in and traceable in nearly all studies of “malady or physical disturbance” (Foucault 65), thus situating sex, through the methods of scientia sexualis and confession in a confined and shameful space, that is at the same time controlled and yet dispersed over the population as a means of subjectification. This western method of producing knowledge regarding sex was in stark contrast to a list of societies, among them: China, Japan, India, Rome (questionably) and Arabic societies, who practiced an ars erotica, 

>In the erotic art, truth is drawn from pleasure itself, understood as a practice and accumulated as experience; pleasure is not considered in relation to an absolute law of the permitted and the forbidden, nor by reference to a criterion of utility, but first and foremost in relation to itself; it is experienced as pleasure, evaluated in terms of its intensity, its specific quality, its duration, its reverberations in the body and the soul. (Foucault 57)

Within the first sentence, Foucault, notes the key difference between scientia sexualis and ars erotica. In ars erotica, pleasure is the site of truth, whereas in scientia sexualis, truth is a problem mediated by not just sex, but a variety of other exterior factors controlled by power structures. However, in his short description of ars erotica, Foucault does delineate the relationship of the master and disciple, the former who is responsible for passing the secrets on in the purest manner so as to maintain the sacred nature of pleasure (Foucault 58). 
  	
## Contemporary Transformations

From solely examining Foucault’s definitions of scientia sexualis and ars erotica, the crucial differences arise in the location of truth and its mediation. Ars erotica was mediated through the master, but this mediation provided access “an absolute mastery of the body, a singular bliss, obliviousess to time and limits, the elixir of life, the exile of death and its threats” (Foucault 58). Scientia sexualis is said to give no such freedom, is immediately tied to the church and science, who coordinate but also clash. Notions of sexuality, that is to say its organization through pedagogy or lack thereof, and its encouraged forms, have have mostly rested in the realm of reproduction. These notions stem from The Church in its historical role as the dominant overarching political power and thus organizer of society. Furthermore, explorations in the issue of sex have always been sanctioned and conducted in conjunction with or directly by the institution of the church under the legitimacy and objectivity of science. Science as an institution has at times been at odds with The Church and the logic of religion; Galileo and his discovery that we were not situated at the center of the universe through divine architecture is an example. But of course, the church has always had more power than science, has condoned or punished science, has repressed or promoted science, has funded and fed science. We can say that science has existed as a branch of the life tree that is The Church and that knowledge and understanding within our society has been entangled with religious convention. Even after the so-called divide of church and state, these conventions remain. Knowing this, it becomes clear why the categorization of sexual behaviour in scientific terms, where Freud is the pop-star in a long history of scientists (and pseudo scientists) is in sync with the condemnations of the church. Describing sexual desires and practices as “abnormalities” and “perversions” which are the results of trauma and malformation is, in a sense, a reiteration of religious rhetoric in a different style of prose. These doubly stated declarations of sexual behaviour have created doubly reinforced notions of sexuality, which are doubly potent in their capacity for control. Straying outside the sexual norms has thus historically borne, not only legal repercussion, but scientific evidence of spiritual and moral malady, which in itself serves as a mental and thus physical constraint on individuals. Far from being the so called “extremes” that we may identify today, the label of sexual deviance was placed on things so inescapable as arousing one’s own body. This dichotomy created a sort of criminality that was difficult to police, yet its moral necessity allowed for breaches of privacy and caused individuals to police their own desires as well as their fellow citizens through confession. I would say that this constant policing of often-unavoidable sexual behavior has instilled a sense of permanent guilt, like the debt of original sin without Jesus. This guilt may or may not be absolved with the more or less inevitable encounters and fulfillments of the individual’s desires but in its place a new guilt emerges. If the individual is to believe what he is told, his desires, once enacted, decisively place him amongst the ill and illegal. Essentially, the sheer irrationality of sexual boundaries created by science and the church has implicated everyone in a degree of illegality and immorality that exists in the present day. Though the institution of the church has receded in power, the ideologies, which were once inseparable from it, remain. The advent of neoliberalism, the moment when the welfare of the family unit ceases to be the organizing factor of society, in place of the market changes the individual’s relationship to society. Some of these changes are difficult to discern, minute even, but this is not the case for sexuality. In the 70’s when neoliberal ideas are beginning to surface with regard to the free market and social values, is the same political moment erotic art breaks into the popular sphere. Obscenity laws are revised and marked by European imports of literature and film (Grove Press’ Tropic of Cancer and I am Curious: Yellow). Industries begin to feel secure in producing erotic content, which is in line with second wave feminism and The Sexual Revolution. In essence The New Capitalism establishes itself alongside The New Liberalism; ubiquitous marketing alongside ubiquitous sex. It is during this moment that pornography begins to establish an industry of its own, through the legitimization of sexual imagery in movie theatres and beyond. 
 
The term pornography as well as what constitutes its content has often come under contention. Generally pornography is categorized as “material containing the explicit description or display of sexual organs or activity, intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings.” This definition conflates with the legal definition of obscenity defined by Miller v. California in 1973 as 

>“(1) whether ‘the average person, applying contemporary community standards’ would find that the work, ‘taken as a whole,’ appeals to ‘prurient interest’ (2) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and (3) whether the work, ‘taken as a whole,’ lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. (LII)

The definition of obscenity is crucial in understanding pornography legitimacy in the public sphere. Where one of the three tenants may be breached by pornographic material, it is unlikely that all three will be. Thus pornography has often escaped censorship but has has also been categorized as belonging to the obscene. However, approaching pornography from the dimension of ars erotic is useful in the way it can illuminate pornography’s ability to illustrate methods of achieving sexual pleasure. The pedagogical nature of ars erotica, with its master and disciple are naturally tied into the relationship of the spectator and his material. Perhaps the most complete example of this is The Kama Sutra, the oldest example of ars erotica. In the Kama Sutra, positions and mannerisms to achieve pleasure are described in detail for the sake of enlightenment, but they nevertheless could be taken as pornographic. In detailing how a man should approach a woman, The Kama Sutra gives specific dialogue that could be used. It is instruction but could nevertheless be stimulating. In this way, it is difficult to separate sexual pedagogy and stimulation. Where ars erotica is concerned this seems contradictory. A degree of experiential learning or at least imagined simulation seems implicit in sexual education. Can someone learn to catch a ball without it ever touching their hands?

The relationship between the pedagogical nature of ars erotica and its overlapping pornographic qualities comes to life in contemporary western neoliberal society. Big Brother Google’s fourth source for ‘sex’ is _Cosmopolitan’s Best Sex Positions and Kama Sutra Tips_. The magazine industry has a full niche devoted to echoing the Kama Sutra for Men and Women. Cosmopolitan regularly cites the Kama Sutra and follows it format, delving into methods of seduction, specific sex positions, taboos and its own form of thinly veiled pornography: reader stories and confessions. 

It is perhaps less interesting to enumerate the ways pornography appears in the public sphere today, or the various ways standard confessional modes are employed in the media today (reality tv, interviews, social media etc.). I would like to focus on a switch in attitude with regards to sexuality and how this may be reflected in contemporary forms of confession with regard to pornography. If the church and state are separated, and God is Dead, the religious and scientific moral code’s grasp on the population has weakened. What rests is the shadow of religious morality and the echoes from institutions that try to maintain an interest in the welfare of the family unit. This is not at all a proclamation, that ideologies which arose when the state was controlled by the church, exerted control over individuals sexual behaviour, favouring heteronormative reproduction and marriage have, disappeared. Rather they have but lost much of their original value. In a neoliberal society, marketing decides what is of value, and it overwhelmingly broadcasts sex as one of its highest values. Pornography is an example of this, being one of the largest industries in American recreational culture. It appears that the sexual truths relegated to the privacy of the confessional and the sexual perversities observed by the sexual scientists have moved into the public sphere. The negative connotations of sexuality, its necessary control through scientia sexualis seems to have gone through a reversal. When individuals have sex on their conscience, rather than visit the dark pseudo-anonymity of the confessional booth, individuals are staying in their own dark rooms with their pseudo-anonymous personal computers. In many ways this can be seen as transformation of old technologies of control. Perhaps Big Brother Google is the new priest and all he asks is that we bring Paypal or our pure monetizable data when we have illicit sex on the brain. This is in line with the dominant perspective that “cultural sexualisation is bad for us – bad for individuals, male and female; bad for the family, nuclear or otherwise; bad for society in general.”  (Mcnair 8). Perhaps "the new sexual revolution is all about flattening sex until it becomes just one more product on the counter of consumer choice” (Mcnair 7). Indeed, In Porn Fast, Shaka McGlotten provides his own confession and details his own involvement in a porn abstinence movement, “Porn-fasters approaches toward self-transformation are entangled with capitalist imperatives to effectively manage oneself, to optimize one’s productivity, to achieve some other state, but this is not necessarily a state that is open to the world” (McGlotten 13). However in his book Confession: Sexuality, Sin and The Subject Jeremy Tambling highlights another alternative to traditional forms of confession. In examining Mikhail Bahktin’s writings on a confessional mode in the novels of Fyodor Doestoevsky he writes,

>“He depicts confession and the confessional consciousness of others in order to show their internally social structure, in order to show that they (confessions) are nothing other than an event of interaction amongst consciousnesses… I cannot manage without another, I cannot become myself without another I must find myself in another by finding another in myself… I receive my name from others, and it exists for others (self-nomination is imposture). Even love towards one’s own self is impossible. Capitalism created the conditions for a special type of inescapably solitary consciousness. Doestoevsky, exposes all the falsity of this consciousness…” (165)

With this analysis of Doestoevsky’s style Bakhtin, ties confession not to the power of the silent auditor of confession, but rather to the necessary definition of the self through the other. Here confession is not a mechanism of control but a necessary exploration of the self. Like the individual who gazes at the screen, drawing pleasure from the identification with the porn stars (or amateurs), from the pulse and proximity of virtual bodies, from the sounds of bodies exerting themselves, from the wetness of the screen or the HD eyes glaring directly through the fourth wall in anticipation, the exploration of ars erotica within pornography allows for a mediation of self, impossible without the presence (real or virtual) of the other. There is no doubt that forms of confession not necessarily associated with sexuality, continue to be a mechanism of power exercised over individuals. Certainly, sexuality too continues to be dictated by scientia sexualis in many capacities, but the overwhelming presence of ars erotica in western society, has loosened the grip that scientia sexualis and confession play in controlling individuals. Ars erotica and its most prominent form, pornography, can engender new forms of confession and mediation of sexuality and pleasure.
