## I. To Begin with...A Crisis
September 15<sup>th</sup>, 2008, Monday, is when it all started: American financial services giant Lehman Brothers filed bankruptcy early in the day, sealing a month-long rumor regarding the future of the struggling Wall Street player.<sup>1</sup> The ensuing saga needs no more elaboration: world economy plummeted to a degree unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s, prompting a series of disasters in the US (e.g. subprime mortgage crisis) and beyond (e.g. European debt crisis) that have yet been fully resolved to this date.<sup>2</sup>

Well, at least, that is the popular version of the story.

Reality is comparatively less dramatic, and despite the sudden fall of Lehman and other financial firms, the crisis did not accumulate all its momentum overnight. The fall of American housing price in 2006 is, in hindsight, probably an early indication of what was later called the Great Recession.<sup>3</sup> Yet, of course, the 2008 crisis is better known for another name: the 2008 Financial Crisis, or the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. I would like to accentuate the adjective “financial”, for it declares with clarity and might that the devastating crisis still engulfing the present has to do, above all, with a particular field of economic activity – finance.

This is an entry on financialization, on the ubiquity of the financial logic in the present era that permeates domains that have little to do with finance or the economic at large. To decompose financialization as it stands today, however, first I have to look back in time and provide a brief account of neoliberalism – the contemporary political regime that nourishes the rise of financialization – in order to contextualize the arguments I make and invoke. Then I will go into more details regarding the adoption of the financial logic in society at large but particularly by nonfinancial sectors, as one manifestation of the neoliberal economization of all aspects of life.<sup>4</sup> Finally, I draw a linkage between the current crisis and financialization, arguing that the pervasiveness of the financial logic has transformed debt, which underpins the current crisis, into _the_ neoliberal tool to stimulate growth.<sup>5</sup>

## II. What is Neoliberalism?
Neoliberalism is, first of all, a politico-economic theory that, since attaining preeminence in the 1970s, has been implemented on a global scale.<sup>6</sup> Michel Foucault lists “Keynesian policy, social pacts of war, and the growth of the federal administration through economic and social programs” – examples of state interventionism spanning the period from the Great Depression to the 1960s – as the three factors that gave rise to neoliberalism as they were resented by the advocates for neoliberalism.<sup>7</sup> In other words, the doctrine of neoliberalism is to maximize individual and societal utilities through minimizing the role of the state in the business of everyday life and instead entrusting the individuals, endowed with freedom, to behave as free agents in free markets wherein free trade and private property rights are respected.<sup>8</sup> This is not to say, however, that the state withdraws itself entirely, but that the obligation of the state is reduced to the preservation of the structure within which free markets can operate and the creation of such setting if necessary.<sup>9</sup>

Yet at the same time, neoliberalism is “a loose and shifting signifier” for it takes on different forms in regard to cultural and regional specificities over the course of its development.<sup>10</sup> Namely, though it is legitimate to label a diverse body of practices as neoliberal at one point or another, these measures can be quite dissimilar and new ones may be introduced to the group. Take financialization as an example. Foucault failed to grasp the elevation of financialization as a neoliberal phenomenon even though he was very well writing at the moment of that shift.<sup>11</sup> The ascendency of debt as a signature feature of financialization is another.<sup>12</sup> The argument: situating the origin of the current crisis or of financialization at a specific date or period is only effective insofar as neoliberalism as the all-encompassing politico-economic logic according to which all the operatives can properly function is acknowledged. September 15<sup>th</sup>, 2008 is not _the_ starting point, but a starting point, in the sense that, with the violence of financialization laid bare in front of the world, the equilibrium is disrupted and perhaps a byproduct – a rupture, as Lazzarato would have it<sup>13</sup> – is produced.<sup>14</sup>

## III. The Logic of Financialization
But what is financialization anyway? It must be recognized, first of all, that financialization has been interpreted quite differently depending on the context and that the use of the word is contingent on historical specificity. From a Marxist perspective, Paul Sweezy has positioned financialization alongside falling rate of growth and the ascendency of multinational monopolies as traits of capitalism in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<sup>15</sup> In this view, financialization has been sought specifically to resolve the overrun of surplus on the marketplace that cannot be simply digested on the part of production.<sup>16</sup> Another is post-Keynesian thought, where the stagnant growth rate, witnessed in the real sector (the financial sector being the opposite), is attributed to the surge of financial sector (financialization).<sup>17</sup> Relying on John Maynard Keynes’ concept of the rentier, post-Keynesians blame the resurgent rentier for the sluggish industrial rate of profit.<sup>18</sup> Yet another prominent approaches include Arrighi’s world-systems theory based on the assumption that US hegemony is coming to an end.<sup>19</sup> And lastly there is the “shareholder value” theory.<sup>20</sup> Christian Marazzi, for instance, locates the origin of financialization in the stagnant growth rate Fordist firms had witnessed since the 1960s, which induced shareholders to seek various measures, and financialization – in other words the participation in financial activities for the purpose of profit maximization – was especially favored as a strategy to restore the rate of return to its former level.<sup>21</sup>

Greta Krippner offers a pioneering critique of the aforementioned approaches, arguing that none is sufficient enough to capture the essence of financialization. Writing in respect to the US economy, Krippner denotes financialization as that trend since roughly the 1960s and 1970s in which financial activities have ascended to constitute the bulk of the US economy.<sup>22</sup> In addition to empirical evidences that indicate the soaring profits of the financial sector, what is indeed more striking is that the nonfinancial sectors have become unprecedentedly reliant on financial activities to generate revenues.<sup>23</sup> Hence while on the one hand the financial sector has profited handsomely from making finance involved in virtually every decision an individual makes – from taking out a loan for mortgage to paying for grocery with you credit card – such engulfment of everyday activities with finance is also extended to the entire economy so that the automobile manufactures, to take one example, have become heavily dependent on their own subsidiaries that specialize in auto loan service to sell their own products. The processes of financialization in different parts of the world are all distinctive but the growth of the financial sector and the dependence that nonfinancial sectors have on financial activities are never lost.<sup>24</sup>

Krippner’s observation has induced Marazzi – despite being a proponent of the “shareholder value” theory that Krippner criticizes – to declare with conviction that contemporary financialization, as opposed to traditional financialization, is no longer premised upon a division but rather a merging of real (industrial) and financial (fictitious) economies.<sup>25</sup> This tendency towards the financialization of virtually everything imaginable is – I would say – an example and indeed an exacerbation of the neoliberal process of economization in which the economic logic is imposed upon every aspect of life.<sup>26</sup> To put it another way: if economization has transformed the motivation of higher education to self-appreciation and investment for the future, then financialization has not only facilitated this process through providing financial “assistance” but also turns something that is traditionally nonfinancial – higher education, for instance – into something doubtlessly financial. Hence, for my purpose here, I denote financialization as the attempt towards total engrossment of all aspects of life down to the most trivial detail through abstract financial products (e.g. mortgage) and above all a financial logic enforced upon each every individual of society.

But what does this financial logic, à la the neoliberal discourse of economization, really do? Once again I turn to Marazzi for some insights. For one, this particular global capitalism revolving around a financial logic as we unanimously and helplessly bear witness today could not have been grown to such a scale if not for the massive debt every national economy has accumulated through – not exclusively but chiefly – indebting the entire [[population|Population (term)]].<sup>27</sup> In other words, it is public debt that has come to fore. But, as you may object, the argument above sounds as if to say public debt is something that appears out of the blue in mid 20<sup>th</sup> century, which clearly is not the case. Granted, this is true, and this is why the financial logic is particularly sinful<sup>28</sup> and ubiquitous in this neoliberal world order.

## IV. Indebted by Financialization
Let me put this out early and clear: debt has, “indebted” to the rise of financialization, become _the_ tool for the neoliberal production of subjectivity. There are quite a few signifiers in the last sentence: debt, financialization, neoliberalism, and subjectivity. I have touched on financialization as well as neoliberalism already, but not debt or subjectivity. At the risk of doing a poor job at condensing complex concepts, not to mention the fact that there are dedicated entries for them in this Wiki, I limit my inquiry exclusively on debt. For more on subjectivity, please find the topic _Subjectivity_ [[here|Subjectivity]]. In this section, I draw a correlation between financialization and debt by way of looking at how financialization has given rise to what Lazzarato calls “_the debt economy_”<sup>29</sup> and how debt has become indispensable for the financial logic to keep on executing the grand scheme of vicious appropriation.

But to arrive at the relationship between financialization and debt, first, I must talk about something else: profit, rent, the new rapport between the two – the becoming rent of profit – and taxation. In pre-neoliberal era, profit was the primary means through which appropriation – that is, sugarcoated confiscation – was carried out; soon, with the advent of neoliberalism, financial rent and taxation have taken on the principal role in the relentless capitalist appropriation/expropriation.<sup>30</sup> Regardless of how you would like to interpret the rise of financialization, there is little doubt that worldwide, the industrial sector – the Fordist firms – had witnessed a significant downfall in rate of profit starting in the 1960s. By the 1970s it was impossible for the world to not have noticed. This has led post-Keynesians – as I have explained earlier – to diagnose the source of the problem as the resurgence of the figure of the rentier in which production has become stagnant due to a lack of investment as accumulation on the part of the rentier has led to low capital liquidity.<sup>31</sup> In any event, profit was falling, the market was panicking, big bonus for executives seemed unlikely, jobs were cut, what to do? This, is where finance enters the picture.<sup>32</sup>

I must make it clear here that I am less concerned about who (or _what_!) was primarily responsible for the rise of financialization, than why financialization seemed the logical approach to take for virtually any concerned party – policymakers, capital owners, and workers – at the time of the crisis of the Fordist model. As I have said, the problem for the Fordist firms was the dropping rate of profit, but what the adoption of financial logic meant, essentially, was that the problem was not addressed directly – that is, the problem was not resolved through new investments on _production_, on the actual infrastructures and human resources without which products would not be produced in the first place.<sup>33</sup> Instead, the extraction of surplus-value continued. But this time, through financialization, practices of value extraction such as direct investment found themselves a new harbor in the sphere of reproduction and distribution.<sup>34</sup> To use the automobile industry as an example. To realize profit maximization, automobile manufacturers now depend heavily on their subsidiaries that specialize in car loan services as well as other financial investments, rather than simply the sale of their cars.<sup>35</sup> The essential mechanism of this migration of accumulating profit in the domain of production to that of circulation and reproduction by way of resorting to financial activities is neatly captured in the phrase: the “becoming-rent of profit”,<sup>36</sup> that I (yes "I", if you substitute "profits" with "marks"!) am making profits out of things I do not own. In other words, increasingly, profit has become, like rent, as “a pure relation of distribution”.<sup>37</sup>  But if the firms are on one end of this process of distribution, who is on the other end? It should be a no-brainer: consumers.

Indeed, without a robust demand that is also large enough, the distribution circuit would not be able support the overflow of financial products and the Fordist firms would have collapsed decades ago. It did not happen, as we know, and as a result consumption and overconsumption became the norm, engendering every member of the population into what Lazzarato calls “the indebted man”.<sup>38</sup> Debt, as you may have guessed, is by no means something novel, and that is quite the case. For a brief history of debt, please see the entry on _[[Debt]]_, also in this Wiki. But what is new about debt in the contemporary setting, however, is that debt – private and public alike – has become financially tradable, which as a result, has provoked a staggering crescendo of debt to a magnitude way out of control. Ironically dubbed “securitization”, such measure allows debt, such as mortgage, to be sold and resold on the financial market to snowball the award for the financial players who have taken part in the transactions.<sup>39</sup> Securitization is “secure” – that is, it promises decent return – until things go wrong – and it is not that crises _could_ happen, but that crises _would_ and _must_ happen.

Financialization has, in other words, embolden the greedy, who would utilize whatever means and disregard whatever ethics so long as this month’s return is as high as last month – a mentality that propelled the shareholders of Fordist firms to demand action, as we have seen. This is most evident in the growth and securitization of subprime mortgage, which – as we have been heard countless times – is responsible for the current crisis that still entraps us. But is it true? To answer, we must first consider what subprime mortgage actually means. People take out a mortgage to buy a property and pay back the mortgage plus interest over years, in most cases. However, as we all know, some can get a decent mortgage with low interest rate, some are less fortunate, and then there are some who cannot get a mortgage at all. The reason is quite straightforward: credit record. Subprime mortgage, therefore, targets those with poor credit records who otherwise are unlikely to take out a mortgage, who at the same time are most vulnerable and most indebted. This is precisely what happened when the American housing market collapsed, which, indeed, was actually delayed due to the securitization of subprime mortgage.<sup>40</sup> What the subprime bubble reveals, henceforth, is that this neoliberal capitalism, characterized by an excessively reliance on financial activities to maintain a high profit level and generate new profit, quite literally seeks to manage and exploit every member of the society, even if it means to indebt the poorest whose prospect of repaying all the debts – debts that have grown exponentially owing to the intervention of the financial logic – is virtually naught.

## V. And...The Beginning of a...?
So, as you may wonder, what can we do other than submitting ourselves to the seemingly inevitable defeat? The sad truth is, my friend, not much. The fact is, neoliberalism has become so pervasive and financialization so fundamental to the proper functioning of our society that even a temporary disruption - like the one we had in 2008 - is extremely costly and detrimental. Yet if the catastrophe in 2008 has taught the world anything, it is that crises are not exceptions but norms and indeed necessary for the relentless capitalistic extraction of value, that those getting even richer from the crises are precisely the ones responsible for the crises in the first place.

This cannot go on.

If capitalism should be understood, indeed, as Félix Guattari has argued, "as absolute control over what is _possible_ and what is _impossible_",<sup>41</sup> and the rhetoric neoliberalism tirelessly feeds us is that there is no alternative, that with neoliberalism we are either at the end of history,<sup>42</sup> or that ideological conflicts have become obsolete,<sup>43</sup> then as a starting point, we can compare "the possible" with "the impossible" and ask: why so? [[Why is heterosexuality considered the norm and other forms of sexuality deviants?|Sexuality (term)]] [[What is norm and why do we have the norms we have?|Norm]] [[Why is population the concern of statistical inquiry and not, say, individuals?|Population (term)]] [[Why is there no longer individuals, but only dividuals?|(In)dividual]] [[Why are we made into the subjects who, working day and night and yet, once a crisis hits the shore, are reduced to bare life?|Neoliberal Technology of Subjectivity]] The list goes on.

Our enemy has left traces left behind, from which we can discern the strategies, the tricks, and the patterns. It is time for us to come up with a counterattack, and react while we still can.

This Wiki can be the place where we start.
