It must have been a drab day for a Target employee until an angry father confronted them while holding a leaflet of baby coupons. In rage the father had asked why his teenage daughter received discounts for baby clothes and cribs in the mail, and in doing so, asked if Target was encouraging her to get pregnant. The manager at the branch, despite being confused, apologized to the dismayed shopper. To apologize once more, the manager called the father, but received an apology from the him instead – “I had a talk with my daughter, it turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been complete aware of. She’s due in August.” This conversation happened in February of 2012, and the story has gained popularity through various social media platforms, with the [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html) being viewed over 4 million times. The story sheds a light as to how corporations have access to their consumer’s lives, and are readily exploiting this knowledge. Such a fact is even more rampant and prevalent today, with the rise of social media sites such as Facebook, eagerly collecting user information to tailor advertisements to each [user](https://github.com/kredati/control-encyclopedia/wiki/User).

Companies are tracking persons as individuals, who are then coded as information to be exploited.  With a contemporary exemplar in mind, I will try to provide a coherent historical backdrop of the how Individual moved towards the In(dividual), as it was originally [conceived](https://github.com/kredati/control-encyclopedia/wiki/In(dividual)#the-individual-created) by Michael Foucault and later reformulated as [dividuals](https://github.com/kredati/control-encyclopedia/wiki/In(dividual)#the-individual-to-the-individual) by Gilles Deleuze. I will provide Cheney-Lippold’s account of the _new algorithmic identity_, in relation to Simone Brown’s view on _surveillant data_ as it pertains to the contemporary moment, in order to illustrate the growing issues that arise when an individual becomes [subjectified](https://github.com/kredati/control-encyclopedia/wiki/In(dividual)#the-individual-subjected) by societies of control.

## The Individual Created
The creation of individuals can be found primarily in the work of Foucault, specifically in his work _Discipline and Punish_. The Foucauldian concept of the individual is understood through the physical body’s relationship with discipline, or that way that it is manipulated. The concrete body must first be made docile before being individualized, so that it may finally be subjected to forms of power. Target had managed to figure out that the teenager in this case study was pregnant before her own father did. She was coded as ‘pregnant’ through the company’s analytics department, and was then targeted for infant products. By using Foucault’s conception of the individual, we can examine how the body of the consumer operates in a distributed space, and how that operation affords their individualization. His work on the individual focuses on the judicial system as his metaphor, where discipline becomes the machinery that creates individuals. 

In looking at the body of the condemned, that is, the body of one that needs to be punished, he acknowledges that there is a political investment of the body, that is “bound up, in accordance with complex reciprocal relations, with its economic use” (25-26). There is already the body that is used for the economy and production situated within his discourse. In looking at punishment in the judicial system, Foucault examines how the criminal is sentenced at first solely through their committed crime. But this view of one’s criminality later shifts when the condemned person is viewed as an individual – whereby they become known through specific criteria, and that they have their own inner life and character. Their sentence did not simply rely on the act anymore, but on the subject as well, it is a codification of his way of life and attitudes. This coding of individualization is not possible without the docile body. If the body is understood as being a useful object, as well as an analyzable body, the body being understood as both manipulatable and intelligible can result in a docile body, one that “may be subjected, used, transformed, and improved” (136).  

From docile bodies, individuals are produced. The teen consumer was analyzed to be pregnant, and turns out, the company’s hunch was correct. As a consumer, she was targeted specifically with the intention that she buys products from them to increase customer loyalty. Already, one sees a docile consumer body that is intelligible and useful to a harbinger of power – Target. The utility of specifically a pregnant customer, is the same as the importance of knowing if the consumer had recently graduated, or recently divorced – in that a major life events allow a flexible (and spot on) prediction of a consumer’s shopping habits. They become “potential gold mines for retailers” as a New York Time article explains. The same article exposes how Andrew Pole, a statistician was responsible for how Target knows if their consumer is pregnant, and what trimester they’re in. These expository pieces of information rely on their customer’s habits, rather, loops of actions that are predictable and useful. Using behavioural psychology, corporations look at the cues that may trigger a specific action, and Andrew Pole of Target had the job of looking at these “cue-routine-reward loops” to predict their shopper’s behaviour. For example, as stated in the 2012 article, a pattern of a pregnant woman, could be that she starts buying a lot of lotion. Later in their pregnancy, they may start buying vitamin supplements and cotton balls. A clue that they may be nearing their due date is that they start buying hand sanitizers and washcloths. Depending on what trimester they are in, Target will choose which products to cater towards them without their knowledge.

Methods of control imposed on a docile body, such as the mechanical instruction given to the soldier on how to move during a march, are what Foucault defines as disciplines. To reiterate, discipline is what allows for the creation of individuals, but this individualization according to him, is not possible without _the distribution of individuals in space_, marked by the need for four things: an enclosure, to “derive maximum advantage” (141), a _partitioning_ that allows discipline to organize analytical space, the space being used as a _functional site_, and finally the definition of each unit (or assembly) as a _rank_. In addition to this, for discipline, individual activities within these spaces need to be controlled through a variety of aspects. A _timetable _is needed at first, to which actions or activities can be tailored to, that is the _temporal operation of the act_. As with the marching soldier, they would have to follow the rhythm of the drum, the same way that there is a _correlation of the body and the gesture_ (i.e. standing up straight, raising one’s hand). Furthermore, there is a body/object relationship, whereby discipline articulates how the body can manipulate an object, and finally,_ exhaustive use_, which extorts a positive economy through the use of time. All theses steps to Foucault, creates individuals, and in the process, allows them to be subjected to forms of power – “the body required to be docile in its minute operations… Disciplinary power has as its correlative an individuality that is not only analytical and cellular, but also natural and organic” (156).

The functional and structural basis of the Foucauldian individual while dated, can still be made coherent in viewing the consumer today. A store, such as Target, can already be read as being an _enclosure_ that is _functional_, as it contains the individuals that they are aiming to market to as efficiently as possible. Before the advent of the internet, one should be reminded of the fact that shopping had to be mostly done in a literal physical enclosure. The concreteness and physicality of the store represents how capitalism operated as Foucault understood it. By tracking each consumer’s shopping habits, such as the teenage daughter in the case study, companies make inferences of their category, being male or female, if they are pregnant, and if so, in which trimester. They are differentiated from the other individuals (partitioned), and are given a rank in the process. A shopper is turned into an individual. What is more to this, is that the stores are able to make such inferences due to their consumers’ habits. Within the enclosed shopping space of Target, the consumer is disciplined, able to follow a timetable (opening and closing times), and are able to follow how they should move their body accordingly with the objects around them (picking up groceries, using a shopping cart, and paying for them at the register). It is these habits that make the consumers docile and vulnerable to be targeted for advertisements. On a microlevel, specifically for a pregnant woman, buying lotion in her first trimester, is an object to body relationship within an enclosure that has temporal importance for the marketer. Such insights are made possible as companies such as Target attach Guest ID numbers to each and every one of their customers to keep track of their buying habits. The individual is obsolete, when viewed in this light, but rather it is the dividual pieces of information that now matter, as Gilles Deleuze theorizes in _Postscript on the Societies of Control_. The Individual becomes an old irrelevant conception, as it has shifted to the In(dividual) with the rise of technology. 

## The Individual to the In(dividual)
Disciplinary societies have become obsolete according to Deleuze; the contemporary moment now presents us instead, with a society of _control_. It is a society that no longer cares about the individual in relation to the masses, it is in place, obsessive about the _dividual _data about individuals that the masses produce. This shift to a society of control, is marked by the shift from enclosures towards, today, to unending loops of networks – individuals had to be trapped into the enclosure’s mold to fit the status quo, “but the man of control… is never finished with anything… undulatory, in orbit, in a continuous network…” (5-6). Control is a modulation that is totally unlike the rigid apparatus of the enclosure, it is ever-evolving, “a sieve whose mesh will transmute to one point -  that sees perpetual training, replacing serial encounters with singular, static institutions” (4).  He attributes this reform to capitalism. Deleuze first looks to machines, as they represent the social forms that create and utilize them, and accordingly, the rise of the computers in the technological revolution represent with it - a mutation of capitalism. Working under an enclosure, say a factory, used to come to mean that capitalism will, in hindsight, come to own one’s house – one’s entire life is trapped within the system. Capitalism in a control society no longer concerns itself with production, but runs solely for the services and stocks. In turn, the physical enclosure is abstracted, the factory now a network that does not aim to _discipline _its individuals, but aims to _control _the dividuals – they become “coded figures (deformable and transformable)” (6). Coded dividual information within a capitalist society, are what enables corporations such as Target to preconceive if their customers might have a bun in the oven.

A company, such as Target, in which individual consumers are coded in, might now be better understood through the lens of a control society. Instead of an enclosure, shopping areas, are now not only concrete, but are now abstracted entities as well. Shopping is available online, and consumers are coded at every single purchase. The most salient thing is how many corporations such as Target in the case study, attribute Guest ID numbers so that they would be able to keep track of this data. Stores are no longer just physical enclosures - every consumer is trapped in a network that is a “self-deforming cast that will continuously change from one moment to the other” (4).  Ads being sent through mail, as well as being imposed on every social media site and television show, become inescapable. As in the case study, the consumer’s dividual data was used with such accuracy that it revealed her state to her father before she had told him, all because the company wanted to _target _her for maximum profit. With the rise of technology, a control society enables capitalism to turn individuals into dividuals that are subjected to control. Through this process of subjection and control, there becomes an issue of _surveillance_, as well as the creation of new _algorithmic identities_, and by looking at both, we can explicitly see how dividualization can allow for subjectification as it pertains to the current moment.

## The In(dividual) Subjected
The individual within a regime of disciplinary power, according to Foucault, can be differentiated and judged at the same time by using the technique of examination. It is a new mechanism that links “to a certain type of the formation of knowledge a certain form of power” (184). It is exactly what affords the individual to be transcribed and documented for possible use. The individual becomes a _case _“as he may be described, judged, measured, compared with others, and it’s also the individual who has to be trained or corrected” (191). The writing system was implemented into the examination, which presents one of the first instances of coding individuals. Coding individuals today is represented mostly within the realm of algorithms, whereby, as John Cheney-Lippold presents in his paper “a new algorithmic identity” is created. Codes are what constitutes the core of a control society, they are the rules that allow access to data, organize them accordingly, they what individualizes the person, and creates abstract dividual data, same way that the daughter in the case study was coded as pregnant. They are what create the identity of a consumer within these continuous networks, coded as new algorithmic identities, or “identity formation that works through mathematical algorithms to infer categories of identity on otherwise anonymous beings… based on their web use” (165). Cheney-Lippold focuses extensively on Deleuze’s discourse on the dividual, as mechanisms of control that used to operate on the body (as in discipline societies), are now wholly divorced from and outside the body. [Subjectivity](https://github.com/kredati/control-encyclopedia/wiki/Subjectivity) is now constructed through a regulative approach that “allows for a distance between power and subject” (169). Dividuals, as the core of control in the digital age, become data that are “aggregated to form unified subjects, of connecting dividual parts through arbitrary closures at the moment of the compilation of a database” (169).  This whole algorithmic interpretive process is made possible by the by consumer’s visibility. 

![dividual](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/13/14/14/head-2062723__480.png)

In viewing surveillance through the lens of blackness and slavery, Simone Brown’s black matters talks about the _surveillant assemblage_, or the result of the “human body ‘broken down’ then reassembled in databases elsewhere to be used” (16). Data becomes dissociated from the individuals they are about, resulting in dividual information that are coded and circulated around the networks of control.  She ties Foucauldian idea of the individual towards the present moment to provide a coherent understanding of surveillance and its issues today, especially within the context of blackness where racialization becomes possible. Racism becomes a glaring issue, where black bodies can be individualized and racially profiled through this process. Surveillance and the individual, become inherently tied together. Another idea she presents is the_ gaze from nowhere_, explicitly represented in the [panopticon](https://github.com/kredati/control-encyclopedia/wiki/Panopticon) (a model created, intended to maximize workforce supervision). Within the panopticon, where surveillance becomes an omnipresent, all-seeing eye, the gaze from nowhere becomes an individualizing gaze, where “simulation, [racial] profiling, and prevention occur, rather than merely observation” (39), in this way surveillance serves to highlight “individuality by making the individual hypervisible and on display” (57). Despite being heralded by scholars as being no longer of use, panopticon’s idea of the _gaze from nowhere_ exemplifies how dividual information can create _new algorithmic identities_, such as the case of a ‘pregnant customer’ within a capitalist control society.

The article “How Companies Learn Your Secrets” from the New York Times highlights the specific case from Target in order to expose the many ways that companies are exploiting their consumers. “For companies like Target, the exhaustive rendering of our conscious and unconscious patterns into data sets and algorithms has revolutionized what they about us and, therefore, how precisely they can sell.” By sharing this article on a social media page, or even if one clicks on it, a person may be coded for something, dividualized, so that they may be targeted. This process of individualization, dividualization, codification, and finally subjection through control, can be aligned neatly towards the pregnant teenage customer, but that is the case, the process itself represents every single consumer within a company’s database. Dividual information becomes the axiom of control for these companies, and consumers are subjected for capitalism’s goals of maximum profit. “Someone asked an important question: How are women going to react when they figure out how much Target knows?... ‘If we send someone a catalog and say, _congratulations on your first child!_ and they’ve never told us they were pregnant, that’s going to make some people uncomfortable,’ Pole [the famed statistician] told me.” (Duhigg). Various issues come along with this subjectification process, in gathering dividual information from individuals, surveillance is needed. Privacy issues come along, as well as issues on biopolitics, to mention a few among a slew of many. 

## Conclusion:
A disciplinary society has been reformed into a control society thanks to capitalism, and together with it, was a shift from the individual towards the digital in(dividual) as Deleuze and Cheney-Lippold has explicated. Michel Foucault’s insights about the development of the individual, may not be as applicable to us in the present moment, but it remains highly relevant and exceedingly so even more today. As Foucault addresses the issue within _The Subject and Power_, “we have been trapped in our own history” (329), the society of control is the result of a discipline of power, and in turn, the dividual’s existence may not be so without enclosures and timetables. Awareness of this history as it now presents itself in the digital age, provides a chance of questioning our relationship as subjected individuals to forms of power, and the issues that may arise as Simone Brown presents them. Our individuality is not a conception to be ignored, but rather it is to be inspected and interrogated so that we may escape this historical entrapment.
