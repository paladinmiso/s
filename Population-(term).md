Most people are familiar with the term ‘population’ as it is commonly used in the sciences: “the total number of persons [or things] inhabiting a country, city, or any district or area” (dictionary.com). While this general dictionary definition is able to capture the quantitative element of the term ‘population,’ it fails to capture the essence of what a population is meant to represent and how it can be utilized as a mode of control. To begin thinking on this level, it is worth asking questions like ‘why institutions collect information about a population when they could gather more precise information about people by studying individuals on a case-by-case basis’ and ‘what the benefits of understanding a ‘population’ are for institutions that need to understand the operation of mechanisms at the macro-level.’ These are issues that are addressed through the works of Michel Foucault, who has contextualized ‘populations’ in relation to a government’s ability to exert control.

This encyclopedia entry seeks to contextualize the term ‘population’ as a unit through which a government exerts control and discuss the evolution of population categorization and its manifestations in governmental control. Part I will discuss Foucault’s foundational works in defining the population-governmentality relationship and exertions of control. Part II will demonstrate how this relationship manifests itself in social structures and state apparatuses using two of Foucault’s other works, *The History of Sexuality* and *Discipline & Control*. Part III, using contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown and Alexander Galloway, will discuss how the relationship established by Foucault has evolved in the neoliberal and digital age and the implications that these contemporary periods have on the exertion of control over ‘populations.’

## I - Origins: The Purpose of a ‘Population’

Understanding the use of ‘population’ as a mode of social control and regulation by governments is easier through the lens of Foucault’s *biopolitics*. As defined in *The Birth of Biopolitics*, biopolitics is “the attempt…to rationalize the problems posed to governmental practice by phenomena characteristic of a set of living beings forming a population: health, hygiene, birthrate, life expectancy, race” (Foucault, 317). A driving element behind this definition is the governmental ‘rationalization’ of the management of population, which is connected to governments’ shift towards the economic mindset (Foucault, “Governmentality,” 215). As Foucault references in “Governmentality,” the government has become concerned with “political economy,” which is “the perception of new networks of continuous and multiple relations between population, territory, and wealth” (217). In contributing to the growing networks, one of the relationships found between population, territory, and wealth was an economic one, which suggests that states should manage and allocate population and territory (as natural resources) in a ways that maximizes its wealth (Foucault, *Security, Territory, Population*, 367). As part of this economic goal, the government needed to figure out how to exert control over a series of individuals (i.e. a population) in order to influence behaviours that would maximize individuals’ value and potential as human ‘resources;’ in this, governments began to use statistics. Foucault’s “Governmentality” described the explicit reframing of the population through statistical terms: 

> “Whereas statistics had previously worked within the administrative frame and thus in terms of the functioning of sovereignty, it now gradually reveals that population has its own regularities, its own rate of deaths and diseases, its cycles of scarcity, and so on; statistics shows also that the domain of population involves a range of intrinsic, aggregate effects, phenomena that are irreducible to those of the family, such as epidemics, endemic levels of mortality, ascending spirals of labor and wealth; finally, it shows that, through its shifts, customs, activities, and so on, population has specific economic effects. Statistics, by making it possible to quantify these specific phenomena of population, also shows that this specificity is irreducible to the dimension of the family” (215-216).

This quote suggests that it, in part, is the ‘quantification’ of characteristics of bodies of people (as populations) that enables governments to “resort to the instrumentality of economic knowledge” and to manage resources within “a society controlled by apparatuses of security” (Foucault, “Governmentality,” 221). In short, statistics allow governments to implement measures that maximize their population as a resource of wealth. [more on Governmentality [[here|Governmentality]]] 

Between *The Birth of Biopolitics*, “Governmentality,” and *Security, Population, Territory*, Foucault’s texts illustrate ‘population’ as one of the foundational bases used by governments to determine how to exert control over individuals. So in general, the term ‘population’ refers to a group of individuals, the identification of characteristics of that group, and its communication through a series of statistical representations. It is through these quantified characteristics that governments are able to design state apparatuses that maximize the economic return of human 'resources' by subjecting the individual to schematized programs of control. 

The nature of these schematized programs will vary by the type of behaviour that the government is seeking to regulate. Though the change in behaviour will take place at the level of the individual, “it is the population itself on which government will act either directly, through large-scale campaigns, or indirectly…without the full awareness of people” (Foucault, “Governmentality,” 217). While it may seem strange to assume that policies that are derived by the quantification of characteristics of a group and applied at the macro level will impact the behaviour of a single individual within that group, this system works because ‘subjects’ can be interpreted on both the individual and population levels. In “The Subject and Power,” Foucault defines the subject as “either divided inside himself or divided from others” (326). As part of this, Foucault references the shift in pastoral power from a power that operated on the level of the individual to the level of the population (“The Subject and Power,” 334). This evolution does not mean pastoral power now excludes ‘subjects as individuals’ in favour of subjects as members of a population (the subject ‘divided from others’). Rather, Foucault states that it impacts both: “agents of pastoral power focused the development of knowledge of man around two roles: one, globalizing and quantitative, concerning the population; the other, analytical, concerning the individual” (“The Subject and Power,” 335). With that, it is possible to understand the exertion of power by the state/government as operating both on the level of the population and the level of the individual. 

## II - The Manifestation of Control via ‘Population’

Given this understanding of ‘population’ as a tool for governments to visualize groups of individuals as economic resources and plan population-level policies that maximize the humans as economic resources, there are two important details to identify: first, the types of behaviours governments are interested in managing on a population-level, and second, how state apparatuses are devised to exert control over subjects in those behaviours. 

Returning to Foucault’s *The Birth of Biopolitics*, biopolitics was meant to regulate characteristics of populations that, in part, are key to population well-being, such as “health, hygiene, birthrate, life expectancy…” (317). Where one of the goals of government is to “strengthen itself by increasing population” (Foucault, *The Birth of Biopolitics*, 5), the types of behaviours governments are going to be interested in managing are those that, as listed, impact the strength and growth rate of a state’s bodies of people. In talking about how governments can influence populations, there are two key areas of control governments hone in on: sex and surveillance. Two of Foucault’s texts specifically have referenced the exertion of control over a population through sex and surveillance: *The History of Sexuality* and *Discipline & Punish*. 

The topic of [[sexuality | Sexuality ]] is interesting because, as Foucault describes in *The History of Sexuality*, sexuality exists at the intersection of control over the individual and the population: where sex became “a political issue…on the one hand it was tied to the disciplines of the body…on the other hand, it was applied to the regulation of populations, through all the far-reaching effects of its activity” (145). On the individual’s level, Foucault cites sexuality as a ‘discipline’ that is responsible for the individual’s ability to usefully interact with society (*The History of Sexuality*, 139). On a population level, sex and sexuality is being moulded by the state apparatus as a means of population perpetuation: “the medical — but also political — project for organizing a state management of marriages, births, and life expectancies; sex and its fertility had to be administered” (Foucault, *The History of Sexuality*, 118). In order to achieve regulation of both the individual and population in these areas, the state ‘polices’ sex to ensure “not the repression of disorder, but an ordered maximization of collective and individual forces” (Foucault, *The History of Sexuality*, 24-25). States removed the taboo of the personal and encouraged confessions around sex to open discourse around sexuality that would enable governments to quantify and detect patterns in sexual behaviour and, thus, create policies that encourage sexual behaviours that further perpetuate a physically healthy body of people for the future (Foucault, *The History of Sexuality*, 19; Foucault, *The History of Sexuality*, 25). As the state understands sexual behaviour in a population-level, it could note “the emergence of demography, the evaluation of the relationship between resources and inhabitants, the constructing of tables analyzing wealth and its circulation” and further enact policies to maximize the economic returns of the population (Foucault, *The History of Sexuality*, 140).

According to Foucault, in making sex and sexuality a ‘public discourse,’ the state “made sex not only a secular concern but a concern of the state as well” (*History of Sexuality*, 116). This shift is important to note because “sex became a matter that required the social body as a whole, and virtually all of its individuals, to place themselves under surveillance” (Foucault, *History of Sexuality*, 116). This shift to surveillance is a necessary transition for the government when engaging with biopolitics because the government’s ability to quantify population’s behaviours depends on its ability to see almost all of the actions of the population as a whole (see the Panopticon). 

Another way to build off the role of surveillance is to look at Foucault’s *Discipline & Punish*, which follows the evolution of punishment and its impact on the surveillance of the individual. In *Discipline & Punish*, Foucault claims “the shift in illegal practices [from a criminality of blood to a criminality of fraud] is correlative with an extension and a refinement of punitive practices” and can be seen as part of “an adaptation and a refinement of the machinery that assumes responsibility for and places under surveillance their everyday behaviour” (77). While this shift seems to apply more on the level of the individual than the population, Foucault asserts that this shift was aimed “to set up a new ‘economy’ of the power to punish…so that it should be distributed in homogenous circuits capable of operating everywhere, in a continuous way” (*Discipline & Punish*, 80). This application of the ‘power to punish’ to be spread out equally through a population lays claims to the ability to surveil a population, which is helpful to the goals of the state since “the practice of placing individuals under ‘observation’ is a natural extension of a justice imbued with disciplinary methods and examination procedures” (Foucault, *Discipline & Punish*, 227). Where the purpose of punishment is to “normalize” and “impose homogeneity,” punishment also “individualizes by making it possible to measure gaps, to determine levels, to fix specialities and to render the differences useful by fitting them one to another” (Foucault, *Discipline & Punish*, 183-184). This enables the state to both quantify the characteristics of the population while forcing the individual, no matter how deviant he is from the population, to conform with its derived ‘statistics.’ Systems of punishment justifies the state’s surveillance (aimed at producing new behavioural controls) while enforcing deviant individuals to join that controlled population. A good summary of this can be seen towards the end of *Discipline & Punish*: 

> “Delinquency, with the secret agents that it procures, but also with the generalized policing that it authorizes, constitutes a means of perpetual surveillance of the population: an apparatus that makes it possible to supervise, through the delinquents themselves, the whole social field. Delinquency functions as a political observatory. In their turn, the statisticians and the sociologists have made use of it, long after the police” (Foucault, 281).

Between *The History of Sexuality* and *Discipline & Punish*, we see that the types of behaviours governments are interested in managing through the population are those that strengthen the size of the population/the health of bodies within the population and that state apparatuses are able to derive policies and methods of control over those behaviours by creating systems of surveillance over populations. In the realm of sexuality, this takes place through the increased ‘public discourse’ of sex. Other behaviours are monitored through the perpetuation of surveillance through systems of punishment. Punishment also explains how states are able to create apparatuses that exert control over the individual: by visualizing/defining populations and then using punishment to ensure deviant bodies conform with those visualizations.  

## III - The Manifestation of Control via ‘Population,’ Recoded

When Foucault introduced the term population as pertains with biopolitics, its relationship with government was in the context of his specific historical moment. Today, the modes through which populations are being quantifiably characterized and categorized have evolved, changing the population-government relationship and the types of control exerted through state apparatus. This section seeks to revisit Foucault’s ideas on the manifestation of control through quantified populations by describing the contemporary role of populations in today’s neoliberal and technology-driven world.

A helpful text for understanding the impact [[neoliberalism | Neoliberalism]] has had on the perception of population is Wendy Brown’s *Undoing the Demos*. Wendy Brown defines neoliberalism as “a peculiar form of reason that configures all aspect of existence in economic terms” (17). Neoliberalism impacts individuals within a population by “[converting]…every human need or desire into a profitable enterprise” (Brown, 28) and creating the expectation that people “maximize their capital value” (Brown, 22). At first glance, the ideas of ‘neoliberalism’ seem to go hand-in-hand with Foucault’s ideas on the goals of governments in managing populations (where the growth of the population is meant to maximize humans as a resource of state wealth). While that goal still exists, Brown points out that the government’s aim under neoliberalism has gone beyond the maximization of population as a resource, instead subjecting the population in ways that create ‘*homo oeconomicus*’ (economic individuals) who “takes its shape as human capital seeking to strengthen its competitive positioning” (33). The creation of the *homo oecononicus* is somewhat problematic for the engagement of the population as a source of state wealth because “when competition becomes the market’s root principle, all market actors are rendered as capitals, rather than as producers, sellers, workers, clients or consumers” (Brown, 65). Whereas under Foucault’s writing it was important for the population to grow, Brown’s contribution to Foucault points out that, under the neoliberal system of interaction with population, “these features of governance and human capital generate a citizen who is both integrated into and identified with the project of the economic health of a nation, a citizen who can be legitimately shed or sacrificed when necessary” (71-72). Thus, Brown suggests that the neoliberal regime may have shifted the relationship between population and government from one of maximizing general resource use to the exploitation of humans as resources (for more on how this is reinforced, see [[Financialization]]). 

Something to consider simultaneously with the introduction of neoliberalism to populations is the impact of [[technology | Technology]], data, and algorithms on the categorization of populations. Alexander Galloway’s book *Protocol* offers an introductory connection between the goals of biopolitics and new digital technologies. Galloway confirms that “biopolitics…connects to a certain statistical knowledge about populations. It is a species-knowledge,” and affirms that “technologies like biometrics and statistical analysis…all fall into the category biopolitics” (12-13). He then defines the relationship identified by Foucault between populations and governments/state apparatus as a “protocological” one (Galloway, 12), where “protocol is a language that regulates flow, directs netspace, codes relationships” within the context of digital technologies (Galloway, 74) [more information on networks [[here | Networks]]]. One item of particular importance is Galloway’s introduction of technology’s ability to engage in “collaborative filtering,” which is a computer’s ability to “predict new characteristics…based on survey data;” collaborative filtering works by inputting data about a single individual and using algorithms to make predictions on the individual “based on the similarity of his or her profile to other users’ profiles in the pool” (Galloway, 113-114). Collaborative filtering is interesting because of the algorithm’s ability “to determine and at the same time inflect the identity of the user” (Galloway, 114). Under Foucault’s regime, the quantified characteristics of the population were used to impose behavioural control on the individual, but the individual’s preferences were somewhat overlooked in determining the prescribed behaviour of the population in favour of the population as a whole. Here, however, Galloway implies that it is possible to attribute characteristics of the individual from those of the population at the same time as the individual contributes to the quantifiable description of the population in general. 

Cheney-Lippold’s piece “A New Algorithmic Identity: Soft Biopolitics and the Modulation of Control” goes more in-depth as to the implications of collaborative filtering on the manifestation of population identity. Cheney-Lippold focuses on how “computer code, statistics and surveillance…construct categories within populations according to users’ surveilled internet history” (164). In doing so, he highlights one of the greatest impacts technology has had on the categorization of populations through quantifiable analysis of population characteristics. Whereas governments used to determine how populations were defined based on the responses of individuals, that may not be the case any more. With digital-driven processes, “as categorizations get constructed by [data] firms…refined by algorithms that process online behaviour, and continually improved upon as more and more time passes and more and more web artifacts are inputted into a database,” these algorithms perceive and create categories on their own terms (Cheney-Lippold, 175). As such, it becomes the digital technology that ascribes identity onto the population and then subjecting individuals within its apparatus to certain behavioural influencers, rather than the government bodies creating policies based off its own statistical interpretation of population data.

In this way, populations may be regaining control of their own identity by having a system reinforce their identity on their behalf - as Tung-Hui Hu suggested in *A Prehistory of the Cloud*, the pipe building for data movement throughout cloud systems “is consonant with the gradual shift…toward a state that is concerned with regulating and optimizing its population even as it leaves the population to itself” (63). This sort of self-reinforcement may continue to be manifested in ways that allows the digital technologies, rather than just the government alone, to subject individuals within the digitalized population to prescriptions in behaviour as well. This idea is echoed by media theorist Kris Cohen in Chapter 5 of *Never Alone, Except for Now*. Cohen suggests that the “serialized self-encounters” that are experienced through the use of search engines are produced by “algorithmic processes that remake us as data points in populations in order to feed the results of these biopolitical processes back to us as personalized results” (40); in essence, the more the individual acts within the digitalized space, the more he/she engages with his/her own reflection as a member of a population and the more he/she is given responses that reflect the behaviours that are prescribed to that population by the algorithms are.

In contrast to the relationship between population and governments and the exertion of power within that relationship as initially established by Foucault, today’s population-government relationship has to take into consideration the economic extremism that has come with the neoliberal environment (as described by Brown) while also taking into consideration the new relationship between population and technology that may be subjecting individuals within the population to identities as produced by the algorithms directly (as Cheney-Lippold suggests) or liberating the population to determine its own identity (as suggested by Hu and Cohen). In the contemporary age, individuals are still being subjected to control through population-determined apparatuses; the question now is ‘who is defining populations, and to what extent are they doing so?’

## IV - Conclusions

This encyclopedia entry has tried to provide a basic understanding of the term ‘population’ as initially introduced by Foucault in *The Birth of Biopolitics*. Part I of this entry defined a population as a group of individuals who can be represented through a series of quantified characteristics (or statistics) and provided a basic understanding of how governments can use statistical populations to exert control over the behaviours of individuals within that group. Part II demonstrated the basic biopolitical manifestation of that government-population relationship, using Foucault’s *The History of Sexuality* and *Discipline & Punish* to describe the role of sexuality and surveillance in maximizing the number of bodies within a population. Part III provided a more modern-day representation of the government-population power dynamics by investigating the impact of neoliberalism and digital technology on the expression of categorization on populations. Between these three sections, it is possible to suggest that the exertion of power over populations is no longer limited to government/state apparatus; with the economicization of individuals within populations and the algorithmic capability of prescribing behaviours over individuals within a population, it will be interesting to see the evolution of bodies in relation to biopower in the future as neoliberalism and technological growth only continue to become more predominant.
