**E. Harris, draft 1**

Most people are familiar with the term ‘population’ on a scientific front, which dictionary.com defines as “the total number of persons inhabiting a country, city, or any district or area.” While the general dictionary definition is able to capture the quantitative element of the term ‘population,’ it fails to capture the essence of what a population is meant to represent and how it can be utilized as a mode of control. Why collect information about a population when you can gather more precise information about human bodies by studying individuals on a case-by-case basis? What purpose does the understanding of a ‘population’ serve to those who need to understand the operation of mechanisms at the macro-level? These are issues that are better addressed through the works of Michel Foucault, who has contextualized the ‘population’ in relation to a government’s ability to exert control. While the manifestation of this power dynamic began with Foucault’s *The Birth of Biopolitics*, the relationship of control between the population and the government has evolved with the changing structures of how populations are organized.

This encyclopedia entry seeks to contextualize the term ‘population’ as a unit through which a government exerts control and discuss the evolution of population categorization and its manifestations in governmental control. Part I will discuss Foucault’s foundational works in defining the population-governmentality relationship and exertions of control. Part II will demonstrate how this relationship manifests itself in social structures and state apparatuses using two of Foucault’s other works, *The History of Sexuality* and *Discipline & Control*. Part III will discuss how the relationship established by Foucault has evolved in the neoliberal and digital age and the implications these periods have on the exertion of control over ‘populations.’

## I - Origins: The Purpose of a ‘Population’

One of the best lens through which to understand the use of population as a mode of social control and regulation by governments is Foucault’s idea of biopolitics. As explicitly defined in *The Birth of Biopolitics*, biopolitics is “the attempt…to rationalize the problems posed to governmental practice by phenomena characteristic of a set of living beings forming a population: health, hygiene, birthrate, life expectancy, race” (317). The key element of this definition is the governmental ‘rationalization’ of the management of population, which speaks to the shift towards the economic mindset for governments (Foucault, “Governmentality,” 215). As Foucault references in “Governmentality,” the government has become concerned with “political economy,” which is “the perception of new networks of continuous and multiple relations between population, territory, and wealth” (217). This relationship between population, territory, and wealth is an economic one in which the state must ensure that it manages and allocates population and territory in a ways that maximizes its wealth (Foucault, *Security, Territory, Population*, 367). As part of this goal of resource management, the government needed to figure out how to exert control over a series of individuals; in this, governments turned to statistics. Foucault’s “Governmentality” defines the explicit reframing of the population through statistical terms: 

> “Whereas statistics had previously worked within the administrative frame and thus in terms of the functioning of sovereignty, it now gradually reveals that population has its own regularities, its own rate of deaths and diseases, its cycles of scarcity, and so on; statistics shows also that the domain of population involves a range of intrinsic, aggregate effects, phenomena that are irreducible to those of the family, such as epidemics, endemic levels of mortality, ascending spirals of labor and wealth; finally, it shows that, through its shifts, customs, activities, and so on, population has specific economic effects. Statistics, by making it possible to quantify these specific phenomena of population, also shows that this specificity is irreducible to the dimension of the family” (215-216).

This quote suggests that the reframing of unit analyses from ‘families’ to ‘population’ allows for a statistical interpretation of large groups of people; it is the ‘quantification’ of characteristics of bodies of people that enables governments to “resort to the instrumentality of economic knowledge” and to manage resources within “a society controlled by apparatuses of security” (Foucault, “Governmentality,” 221).  

Between *The Birth of Biopolitics*, “Governmentality,” and *Security, Population, Territory*, Foucault’s texts illustrate ‘population’ as one of the foundational bases used by governments to determine how to exert control over individuals. So in general, the definition of a ‘population’ refers to a group of individuals, the identification of characteristics of that group, and its communication through a series of statistical representations. It is through these quantified characteristics that governments are able to design state apparatuses that maximize the economic return of human resources by subjecting the individual to schematized programs of control. 

The nature of these schematized programs will vary by the type of behaviour that the government is seeking to regulate. However, what is key to understand is that though the change in behaviour will take place at the level of the individual, “it is the population itself on which government will act either directly, through large-scale campaigns, or indirectly…without the full awareness of people” (Foucault, “Governmentality,” 217). While it may seem somewhat strange to assume that policies that are derived by the quantification of characteristics of a group will be impactful on the behaviour of a single individual within that group, this system works because ‘subjects’ can be interpreted within both the individual and population levels. For this, it is helpful to turn to Foucault’s “The Subject and Power.” In this piece, Foucault defines the subject as “either divided inside himself or divided from others” (326). In discussing the evolution of pastoral power, Foucault references the shift in pastoral power from a power that operated on the level of the individual to the level of the population (“The Subject and Power,” 334). This evolution does not mean pastoral power now excludes an interpretation of subjects as individuals in favour of subjects as members of a population; rather, as Foucault stated, it does both “the multiplication of the aims and agents of pastoral power focused the development of knowledge of man around two roles: one, globalizing and quantitative, concerning the population; the other, analytical, concerning the individual” (“The Subject and Power,” 335). As such, it is possible to understand the exertion of power by the state/government as able to operate both on the level of the population and the level of the individual. 

## II - The Manifestation of Control via ‘Population’

Given this understanding of ‘population’ as a tool for governments to visualize groups of individuals as economic resources and plan population-level policies that maximize the humans as an economic resource, there are two important themes to identify: first, the types of behaviours governments are interested in managing on a population-level, and second, how state apparatuses are devised to exert control over subjects in those behaviours. 

Returning to Foucault’s *The Birth of Biopolitics*, biopolitics was meant to regulate the area of “characteristic[s] of a set of living beings forming a population: health, hygiene, birthrate, life expectancy, race…” (317). Where one of the key goals of government is to “strengthen itself by increasing population” (Foucault, *The Birth of Biopolitics*, 5), the types of behaviours governments are going to be interested in managing are those that , as described above, impact the strength and growth rate of a state’s population (bodies of people). This can include schemes that manage “the stimulation of birth rates” or “the directing of the flow of population into certain regions or activities” (Foucault, “Governmentality,” 217). These two examples in particular are useful in that they cite two areas over which control can be exerted to influence population: sex and surveillance over movement. Two of Foucault’s texts specifically have referenced the exertion of control over a population through sex and surveillance: *The History of Sexuality* and *Discipline & Punish*. 

The topic of sexuality is an interesting one because, as Foucault contextualizes it in *The History of Sexuality*, sexuality exists at the intersection of control over the individual and the population: where sex became “a political issue,” “on the one hand it was tied to the disciplines of the body…on the other hand, it was applied to the regulation of populations, through all the far-reaching effects of its activity” (145). Briefly on its impact on the individual body, Foucault cites sexuality as a ‘discipline’ that is responsible for the individual’s ability to usefully interact with the society created around it (139). At the same time, sex and sexuality is being moulded by the state apparatus as a means of population perpetuation: “the medical — but also political — project for organizing a state management of marriages, births, and life expectancies; sex and its fertility had to be administered” (118). In order to achieve regulation of both the individual and population in these areas, the state had to ‘police’ sex to ensure “not the repression of disorder, but an ordered maximization of collective and individual forces” (24-25), and it did so by encouraging “useful and public discourse” (25). The purpose of the state removing the taboo of the personal and encouraging confessional behaviour around sex (19) was to open discourse around sexuality that would enable governments to quantify and detect patterns in sexual behaviour (25) and, thus, create policies that encourage sexual behaviours that further perpetuate a healthy body of people for the future. As the state further understood the perpetuation of the population, it could continue to note “the emergence of demography, the evaluation of the relationship between resources and inhabitants, the constructing of tables analyzing wealth and its circulation” and maximize the economic returns of the population (140).

According to Foucault, in making sex and sexuality a ‘public discourse,’ the state “made sex not only a secular concern but a concern of the state as well” (*History of Sexuality*, 116). However, in doing so, Foucault points out something very important: “sex became a matter that required the social body as a whole, and virtually all of its individuals, to place themselves under surveillance” (*History of Sexuality*, 116). The role of surveillance in monitoring the activities and behaviour of populations is important to further investigate considering the government’s ability to quantify population’s behaviours requires the government to be able to see almost all of actions of the population as a whole. In transitioning to the surveillance of a population, it is helpful to turn to Foucault’s *Discipline & Punish*. *Discipline & Punish* follows the evolution of punishment and its impact on the surveillance of the individual; for example, “the shift in illegal practices [from a criminality of blood to a criminality of fraud] is correlative with an extension and a refinement of punitive practices” and can be seen as part of “an adaptation and a refinement of the machinery that assumes responsibility for and places under surveillance their everyday behaviour…another policy for that multiplicity of bodies and forces that constitute a population” (77-78). While this shift in punishment exerted seems to apply more on the level of the individual than the population, it is important to understand that “the true objective of the reform movement…was not so much to establish a new right to punish based on more equitable principles, as to set up a new ‘economy’ of the power to punish…so that it should be distributed in homogenous circuits capable of operating everywhere, in a continuous way” (80). This application of the ‘power to punish’ to be spread out equally through a population lays claims to the ability to surveil a population, which is helpful to the goals of the state since “the practice of placing individuals under ‘observation’ is a natural extension of a justice imbued with disciplinary methods and examination procedures” (227). Where the purpose of punishment is to “normalize” and “impose homogeneity,” punishment also “individualizes by making it possible to measure gaps, to determine levels, to fix specialities and to render the differences useful by fitting them one to another” (183-184), enabling the state to both quantify the characteristics of the population while forcing the individual, no matter how deviant he is from the population originally, to conform with that derived ‘statistic.’ As such, punishment enables the state to surveil in ways that produce better insights to produce new behavioural controls while enforcing deviant individuals to join that controlled population. A good summary of this can be seen in Foucault’s quote towards the end of *Discipline & Punish*: 

> “Delinquency, with the secret agents that it procures, but also with the generalized policing that it authorizes, constitutes a means of perpetual surveillance of the population: an apparatus that makes it possible to supervise, through the delinquents themselves, the whole social field. Delinquency functions as a political observatory. In their turn, the statisticians and the sociologists have made use of it, long after the police” (281).

Between *The History of Sexuality* and *Discipline & Punish*, it is possible to see the two themes this section started out to identify. First, the types of behaviours governments are interested in managing through the population are those that strengthen the size of the population as well as the health of those bodies within the population; this takes place through the ‘secularization’ of sex and sexuality. Second, state apparatuses are able to derive policies and methods of control over those behaviours by creating systems of surveillance over the population. In the realm of sexuality, this takes place through the increased ‘public discourse’ of sex; in other realms, however, behaviours are monitored through the perpetuation of surveillance through systems of punishment. This system of punishment also explains how states are able to create apparatuses that exert control over the individual: by visualizing populations and then using punishment to make deviant bodies conform with those visualizations. 

## III - The Manifestation of Control via ‘Population,’ Revisited and Recoded

When Foucault introduced the term population in the context of biopolitics, its relationship with the government was in the context of a specific historical moment (particularly that of a liberal moment). Today, the modes through which populations are being categorized and quantifiably characterized have evolved; this evolution will change the relationship between population and governments and the type of control exerted through state apparatus. This section seeks to revisit Foucault’s ideas on the manifestation of control through the quantified characteristics of population and apply them to today’s neoliberal and technology-driven world.

In terms of the impact of the evolution into the neoliberal world on the perception of population, two helpful texts are Wendy Brown’s *Undoing the Demos* and Maurizio Lazzarato’s *Governing by Debt*. Wendy Brown defines neoliberalism as “a peculiar form of reason that configures all aspect of existence in economic terms” (*Undoing the Demos*, 17). Some of the key characteristics of the neoliberal state is the “the financialization of everything and the increasing dominance of finance capital over productive capital in he dynamics of the economy and everyday life” (28). Where neoliberalism impacts individuals within a population is “the conversion of every human need or desire into a profitable enterprise” (28), the expectation that people “maximize their capital value” (22). At first glance, the ideas of ‘neoliberalism’ seem to go hand-in-hand with the goals of governments in managing populations during Foucault’s time period, particularly where the growth of the population is meant to maximize humans as a resource of state wealth. That is still true, but what Brown’s book points out is the fact that the government’s aim under neoliberalism has gone beyond the maximization of population as a resource by subjecting the population to create the ‘*homo oeconomicus*,’ or the ‘economic individual’ who “takes its shape as human capital seeking to strengthen its competitive positioning” (33). The creation of the *homo oecononicus* is somewhat problematic for the engagement of the population as a source of state wealth, particularly where “when competition becomes the market’s root principle, all market actors are rendered as capitals, rather than as producers, sellers, workers, clients or consumers” (65). Where under Foucault’s writing it is important for the population to grow, Brown’s contribution to Foucault points out that under the neoliberal system of interaction with population, “these features of governance and human capital generate a citizen who is both integrated into and identified with the project of the economic health of a nation, a citizen who can be legitimately shed or sacrificed when necessary” (71-72). 

While *Undoing the Demos* points out the problematic subjective placement of the population in an increasingly financialized environment, Lazzarato’s *Governing by Debt* offers further insights into how populations become subjected to the financialized environment. For example, Lazzarato points out that “taxation measures less production than power and control exercised over the population,” particularly where taxation can be seen as “the appropriation of the population’s income” (36). This example of taxation is particularly interesting because Lazzarato depicts the taxation as the government’s way of subjecting individuals within a population collectively; as he describes it, “taxation acts as a powerful vector for the transformation of each of us into the indebted man,” especially where “when ‘public debt’ is not honoured, the fault is not rectified individually but collectively — through taxes” (41). While taxation is only one example that Lazzarato includes of the government imposing financialization onto the population, what is possible to see between Brown and Lazzarato is a depiction of how the financialization that has occurred under the neoliberal regime may have shifted the relationship between population and government from one of maximizing general resource use to the exploitation of a human resources.

Simultaneously to the introduction of the neoliberal and the financialization of populations, there are also questions as to the impact technology, data, and algorithms have had on the categorization of populations. Alexander Galloway’s book *Protocol* has offered an introductory connection between the goals of biopolitics and new digital technologies, such as computers. Galloway begins by confirming that “biopolitics…connects to a certain statistical knowledge about populations. It is a species-knowledge,” and affirms that “technologies like biometrics and statistical analysis…all fall into the category biopolitics” (12-13). He then defines the relationship identified by Foucault between populations and governments/state apparatus as a “protocological” relationship (12), where “protocol is a language that regulates flow, directs netspace, codes relationships” within the context of digital technologies (74). One item of particular importance is Galloway’s introduction of technology’s ability to engage in “collaborative filtering,” which is a computer’s ability to “predict new characteristics…based on survey data;” collaborative filtering works by inputting data about a single individual and using algorithms to make predictions on the individual “based on the similarity of his or her profile to other users’ profiles in the pool” (113-114). What makes collaborative filtering so interesting is the algorithm’s ability “to determine and at the same time inflect the identity of the user” (114). Whereas under Foucault’s regime the quantified characteristics of the population were used to impose behavioural control on the individual, the individual was somewhat overlooked in determining the prescribed behaviour of the population in favour of the population as a whole; here, however, Galloway implies that it is possible to attribute characteristics of the individual from the population while the individual contributes to the quantifiable description of the population in general. 

Cheney-Lippold’s piece “A New Algorithmic Identity: Soft Biopolitics and the Modulation of Control” goes more in-depth as to the implications of collaborative filtering on the manifestation of biopower. Cheney-Lippold focuses largely on how “computer code, statistics and surveillance…construct categories within populations according to users’ surveilled internet history” (164). In doing so, he is able to demonstrate one of the greatest impacts technology has had on the categorization of populations through quantifiable analysis of population characteristics. Whereas governments and individuals within the population used to be able to determine in part how they were identified based on their responses, “as categorizations get constructed by firms like Quantcast, refined by algorithms that process online behavior, and continually improved upon as more and more time passes and more and more web artifacts are inputted into a database” these algorithms perceive and create categories on their own terms (175). As such, it is the digital technology that is ascribing identity onto the population and then subjecting individuals within its apparatus to certain behavioural influencers, rather than the government bodies creating policies based off its own statistical interpretation of population data.

In this way, populations may be regaining control of its own identity by having a system reinforce its identity on its behalf - as Tung-Hui Hu suggested in *A Prehistory of the Cloud*, the pipe building for data movement throughout cloud systems “is consonant with the gradual shift…toward a state that is concerned with regulating and optimizing its population even as it leaves the population to itself” (63). This sort of self-reinforcement may continue to be manifested in ways that allows the digital technologies, rather than just the government alone, to subject individuals within the digitalized population to prescriptions in behaviour as well. As Kris Cohen suggested in Chapter 5 of *Never Alone, Except for Now*, the “serialized self-encounters” that are experienced through the use of search engines are produced by “algorithmic processes that remake us as data points in populations in order to feed the results of these biopolitical processes back to us as personalized results” (40); in essence, the more the individual acts within the digitalized space, the more it engages with its reflection as a member of a population and the more it is given responses that reflect what the behaviours that are prescribed to that population by the algorithms are.

In contrast to the relationship between population and governments and the exertion of power within that relationship as initially established by Foucault, today’s population-government relationship has to take into consideration the financialization that has come with the neoliberal environment (as described by Brown and Lazzarato) while also taking into consideration the new relationship between population and technology that may be subjecting individuals within the population to identities as produced by the algorithms directly (as Cheney-Lippold suggests) or liberating the population to determine its own identity (as suggested by Tung-Hui Hu and Kris Cohen).

## IV - Conclusions

This encyclopedia entry has tried to provide a basic understanding of the term ‘population’ as initially introduced by Foucault in *The Birth of Biopolitics*. Part I of this entry defined a population as a group of individuals who can be represented through a series of quantified characteristics (or statistics) and provided a basic understanding of how governments can use statistical populations to exert control over the behaviours of individuals within that group. Part II demonstrated the basic biopolitical manifestation of that government-population relationship, using Foucault’s *The History of Sexuality* and *Discipline & Punish* to describe the role of sexuality and surveillance in maximizing the number of bodies within a population. Part III provided a more modern-day representation of the government-population power dynamics by investigating the impact of neoliberalism/financialization and digital technology on the expression of categorization on populations. Between these three sections, it is possible to suggest that the exertion of power over populations is no longer limited to government/state apparatus; with the financialization of individuals within populations and the algorithmic capability of prescribing behaviours over individuals within a population, it will be interesting to see the evolution of bodies in relation to biopower in the future as neoliberalism and technological growth only continue to become more predominant.
